<h1>Idea Tracker</h1>

<p>
    I usually list potential far-future projects on a notepad (Sticky Notes on my PCs, Color Note on my phone, etc.) but it makes more sense to centralize them in one place instead.  These ideas could or could not exist/be feasible, but they are interesting to think about.

            <td>Universal playlist downloader from major music applications (e.g. Spotify, Youtube, etc.)  Also allow for changing Song Metadata, maybe also mobile version for on-the-go mixtapes!</td>

            <td>Room Planner</td>
            <td>2D/3D room universal room planner to help make it easier for furniture planning in a room.  Ones I've seen/used all have some arbitrary quirks that make it difficult to use (e.g. actual brand-specific items instead of allowing for manual dimension changin)</td>

            <td>AI-powered resume job finder</td>
            <td>It never made sense to me why people need to look for jobs instead of companies looking in some central database for people who would fit their needs.  So this standardizes people's resume's and establishes a collection for which companies can use to look for potential applicants to ping directly instead of the other way around/using 3rd-party recruiters!</td>
            <td>Future project (collab?), can expand on AI/ML tech stacks!</td>

            <td>Bet-You-Can't-Find</td>
            <td>Another AI/ML project, application to find random/obscure references in various media sources (arbitrary ex: find Tom Cruise saying "Gotcha" to a blond-haired elderly lady - Found in Exhibit A "Random Movie Title" at time "49:23", etc.)</td>
            <td>Long-term, but definitey interesting!</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Frame-by-frame Clipping</td>
            <td>Similar to Bet-You-Can't-Find, but instead splits events frame-by-frame.  Example: NBA Basketball by time frames in a single possession to see what is occuring (Players 1 spacing in the corner for 6 seconds before cutting towards the basket by the line while Player 3 sets up the play, finishing with a lob to a Player 1 dunk)</td>
            <td>For-Fun, might consider mid-far future if I decide to play with various sports api/sources!</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Universal API library/repository</td>
            <td>Single-source API library to allow 1-size-fits-all source to use instead of trying to find & license dozens of 3rd party APIs across the web.</td>
            <td>Universally useful, but exceedingly unlikely due to ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°</td>
