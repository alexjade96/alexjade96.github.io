<h1>Game Info Page</h1>

<p>
    I always have random thoughts about tracking information for optimization purposes in games that I play, so I've decided to make a start of listing things here that I want to eventually build or keep track of

<table class="table-auto">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Game Image</th>
            <th>Game</th>
            <th>Tracking Info</th>
            <th>Examples</th>
            <th>Progression?</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./images/umamusume.jpeg" alt="Logo" class="object-contain"/></td>
            <td>Uma Musume - Pretty Derby</td>
            <td>Recommended skills for career mode</td>
            <td>Firm Conditions vs Wet Conditions (How many races have Firm-type ground vs Wet sub-types)</td>
            <td>Currently Theorycrafting</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
